1. isTerminalState() is used in begining of your move in minmax. Obviously it's not a win state if you are able to move.
    Maybe check for opponent win?
2. if non intersecting sequence of markers is formed, what is the expected order of move.
    Can we remove a seq, then ring and then again a seq and ring, or do we have to first remove both the 
    seq and then both the rings.
3. vector<int> arr();      vs.          vector<int> arr = vector<int>();
